We introduce a NAS benchmark for text classification task, consisting of 4k ECGP-evolved architectures on MR, 3.4k on SST2, and 3.5k on SST5, 
along with their respective performances. By leveraging a designated function set, including Attention, Convolution, GRU, etc., 
the top-performing architecture achieves accuracy rates of 80%, 85%, and 47% on MR, SST2, and SST5, respectively.
